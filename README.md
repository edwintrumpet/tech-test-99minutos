```json
{
  "height": 5
}
```

---

}
```
**response:**
```json
{
  "bfs": [9, 6, 11, 2, 8, 13, 0, 12, 17, 18]

### Error response

All errors have the same structure

This is the Node not found in tree error for develop mode

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Node is not found in tree",
  "stack": "Error: Node is not found in tree\n    at Tree.getNode..."
